## Description

The FeedBack Form Application allows the user to scale offer a value between 1 through 5 based on how they felt.
The user will be asked how they are feeling, how well they are understanding the material, whether they feel supported by the staff, and will then have an opportunity to comment further.

The user will be given a brief description of the process on the homepage, and can then click "start feedback" to begin filling out the survey.

At the end of the survey the user can then review their responses before submitting them to the database. If the user is not satisfied with their response, they may use the buttons in the navbar to return to that specific response and change accordingly.
